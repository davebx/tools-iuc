This program parses the delta alignment output of nucmer and promer and displays the coordinates, and other useful information about the alignments.

Output is tabular. Below is a description of each column:
    * **[S1]** Start of the alignment region in the reference sequence
    * **[E1]** End of the alignment region in the reference sequence
    * **[S2]** Start of the alignment region in the query sequence
    * **[E2]** End of the alignment region in the query sequence
    * **[LEN 1]** Length of the alignment region in the reference sequence, meausred in nucleotides
    * **[LEN 2]** Length of the alignment region in the query sequence, meausured in nucleotides
    * **[% IDY]** Percent identity of the alignment, calculated as (number of exact matches) / ([LEN 1] + insertions in the query)
    * **[% SIM]** Percent similarity of the alignment, calculated as [% IDY] but counting positive BLOSUM matrix scores instead of exact matches
    * **[% STP]** Percent of stop codons of the alignment, calculated as (number of stop codons) / (([LEN 1] + insertions in the query) * 2)
    * **[LEN R]** Length of the reference sequence
    * **[LEN Q]** Length of the query sequence
    * **[COV R]** Percent coverage of the alignment on the reference sequence, calculated as [LEN 1] / [LEN R]
    * **[COV Q]** Percent coverage of the alignment on the query sequence, calculated as [LEN 2] / [LEN Q]
    * **[FRM]** Reading frame for the reference sequence and the reading frame for the query sequence respectively.  This is one of the columns absent from the nucmer data, however, match direction can easily be determined by the start and end coordinates.
    * **[TAGS]** The reference FastA ID and query FastA ID

There is also an optional final column (turned on with the -w or -o option) that will contain some 'annotations'. The -o option will annotate alignments that represent overlaps between two sequences, while the -w option is antiquated and should no longer be used. Sometimes, nucmer or promer will extend adjacent clusters past one another, thus causing a somewhat redundant output, this option will notify users of such rare occurrences.

The -c and -l options are useful when comparing two sets of assembly contigs, in that these options help determine if an alignment spans an entire contig, or is just a partial hit to a different read. The -b option is useful when the user wishes to identify sytenic regions between two genomes, but is not particularly interested in the actual alignment similarity or appearance. This option also disregards match orientation, so should not be used if this information is needed.
