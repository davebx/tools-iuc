System Requirements
===================

-  **Memory**: To run efficiently, RNA-STAR requires enough free memory to
   hold the SA-indexed reference genome in RAM. For Human Genome hg19 this is
   index about 27GB and running RNA-STAR requires approximately ~30GB of RAM.
   For custom genomes the rule of thub is to multiply the size of the 
   reference FASTA file with 9 to get the estimated required amount of RAM.
